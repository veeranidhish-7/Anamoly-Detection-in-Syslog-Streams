# In-Depth Code Explanation: The Core Architecture

Out of the many scripts used in this project, four core Python files form the absolute mathematical foundation of our final results. We transitioned from linear baselines to semantic deep learning models. This document provides a literal, line-by-line English translation of the core logic inside these scripts.

---

## 1. The Core Linear Baselines (`pca_rpca.py`)
This file implements the mathematical models used by the base paper, which we proved required L2 normalization to work on the HDFS dataset.

```python
import numpy as np

def l2_normalize(X):
    # Calculate the Euclidean length (L2 norm) of every row in the dataset 'X'.
    norms = np.linalg.norm(X, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    # If any row is completely empty (norm is 0), change it to 1 to prevent division by zero errors.
    norms[norms == 0] = 1.0
    # Divide every value in the row by the row's total length, forcing all points onto a unit sphere.
    # (This is the undocumented breakthrough that allowed us to match the paper's 94.65% PCA score).
    return X / norms

class PCAModel:
    def __init__(self, k=6):
        # Initialize the PCA model and set 'k', which is the number of principal components (dimensions) to keep. 
        # We use 6 as stated in the paper.
        self.k = k
        self.mean_ = None
        self.P_ = None
        
    def fit(self, X):
        # Calculate the average (mean) across all the columns of the training data.
        self.mean_ = X.mean(axis=0)
        # Subtract the mean from the data. This centers the data around the origin (0,0) on a graph.
        X_c = X - self.mean_
        # Perform Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a linear algebra operation that finds the directions of maximum variance in the data.
        _, _, Vt = np.linalg.svd(X_c, full_matrices=False)
        # Extract the top 'k' most important directions (the top 6 components) and save this as the projection matrix P.
        self.P_ = Vt[:self.k].T
        
    def predict_errors(self, X):
        # Center the new, unseen test data using the mean we calculated during training.
        X_c = X - self.mean_
        # Project the data down into our 6-dimensional "normal" space, and then immediately project it back out to the original space.
        X_proj = X_c @ self.P_ @ self.P_.T
        # Calculate the distance between the original data and the projected data. 
        # If the distance is large, it means the data didn't fit our "normal" space, making it an anomaly.
        errors = np.linalg.norm(X_c - X_proj, axis=1)
        return errors
```

## 2. The Semantic NLP Embeddings (`extract_embeddings.py`)
This file represents our major contribution: moving away from simple frequency counting and using Natural Language Processing to understand the sequence and context of the logs. Crucially, this script contains the structural "Node-Based" grouping fix for BGL.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from gensim.models import Word2Vec

def extract_bgl_embeddings():
    # Load the parsed, structured supercomputer logs from a CSV file.
    df = pd.read_csv("data/BGL/preprocessed/BGL.log_structured.csv")
    
    # Define a time window of 6 hours (6 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds).
    window_size_seconds = 6 * 60 * 60
    # Create a new column 'Window_ID' by dividing the raw Unix timestamp by the window size.
    df['Window_ID'] = df['Timestamp'] // window_size_seconds
    
    # If the log's label is '-', it's normal (0). Otherwise, it's anomalous (1).
    df['Label_Bin'] = df['Label'].apply(lambda x: 0 if x == '-' else 1)
    
    # THIS IS THE BREAKTHROUGH: Instead of grouping purely by time, we group the logs by their physical server 'Node' AND the time window.
    # This aligns the logs to their actual physical execution path, fixing the "Semantic Soup" problem.
    grouped = df.groupby(['Node', 'Window_ID'])
    
    # Extract the sequence of events (e.g., ['Login', 'Query', 'Logout']) for each specific Node block.
    sequences = grouped['EventId'].apply(list).values
    # If any single log in this sequence is anomalous, mark the entire sequence as anomalous (1).
    y = grouped['Label_Bin'].max().values
    
    # Train the Word2Vec NLP model on these sequences to learn the semantic meaning of log transitions.
    train_and_save_w2v(sequences, y, "data/BGL/preprocessed/features_w2v.npz")

def train_and_save_w2v(sequences, y, output_npz, vector_size=32):
    # Train the Word2Vec model, converting each unique log template into a 32-dimensional dense mathematical vector.
    model = Word2Vec(sentences=sequences, vector_size=vector_size, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4, sg=1)
    
    # Create an empty matrix to hold the final embedding for every sequence.
    X_w2v = np.zeros((len(sequences), model.vector_size), dtype=np.float32)
    
    # Loop through every sequence we generated.
    for i, seq in enumerate(sequences):
        # Look up the 32-dimensional vector for every log in the sequence.
        vecs = [model.wv[token] for token in seq if token in model.wv]
        if vecs:
            # Average (mean) all the log vectors together to create one single vector that represents the entire sequence's meaning.
            X_w2v[i] = np.mean(vecs, axis=0)
            
    # Apply L2 Normalization to these semantic vectors, pushing them onto a uniform unit sphere for stability.
    norms = np.linalg.norm(X_w2v, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    norms[norms == 0] = 1.0
    X_l2 = X_w2v / norms
    
    # Save the final semantic math vectors to a file.
    np.savez(output_npz, X_l2=X_l2, y=y)
```

## 3. The Ultimate Model: Deep Learning Autoencoder (`deep_learning.py`)
Linear PCA fails to process the non-linear semantic Word2Vec space efficiently. This script builds a neural network that learns the normal patterns of the semantic space, which successfully broke the 65% linear ceiling and achieved 87.46% on the BGL supercomputer.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

class AutoencoderModel:
    def __init__(self, hidden_layer_sizes=(16, 8, 16), random_state=42):
        # Initialize a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network acting as an Autoencoder.
        # It takes the 32-dimensional semantic input, squeezes it through a 16-node layer, 
        # a tiny 8-node bottleneck layer, and expands it back through a 16-node layer.
        self.clf = MLPRegressor(
            hidden_layer_sizes=hidden_layer_sizes,
            activation='relu', # Use the Rectified Linear Unit activation function to handle non-linear data.
            solver='adam',     # Use the Adam optimizer to update the network weights efficiently.
            max_iter=500,      # Allow it to train for up to 500 epochs (passes over the data).
            random_state=random_state,
            early_stopping=True # Stop training early if the model stops improving, to prevent overfitting.
        )
        self.mean_ = None

    def fit(self, X):
        # Calculate the average of the semantic vectors to center the data.
        self.mean_ = X.mean(axis=0)
        X_c = X - self.mean_
        
        # Train the neural network. The key to an Autoencoder is that the input (X_c) is exactly the same as the target (X_c).
        # The network must learn to compress the data through the tiny 8-node bottleneck and reconstruct it perfectly.
        # It learns to do this perfectly for "normal" data.
        self.clf.fit(X_c, X_c)

    def predict_errors(self, X):
        # Center the new unseen test data.
        X_c = X - self.mean_
        
        # Ask the trained neural network to try and reconstruct this new data from the bottleneck.
        X_reconstructed = self.clf.predict(X_c)
        
        # The Anomaly Score is simply the mathematical distance between the original data and the network's attempted reconstruction.
        # If the network sees an anomaly, it won't know how to reconstruct it, resulting in a massive error score.
        scores = np.linalg.norm(X_c - X_reconstructed, axis=1)
        return scores
```

## 4. The Dynamic Thresholding: Extreme Value Theory (`thresholding.py`)
The base paper cheated by hardcoding a 95% threshold limit because they already knew exactly how many anomalies existed in the dataset. This script uses advanced statistics to calculate the threshold automatically, making the AI deployable in the real world.

```python
import numpy as np

def compute_threshold_pot(errors, q=0.90, target_fpr=1e-4):
    # This uses Peaks-Over-Threshold (POT), a branch of Extreme Value Theory.
    
    # Step 1: Find the score that represents the 90th percentile of errors (the start of the "tail" of the graph).
    u = np.quantile(errors, q)
    
    # Step 2: Extract all error scores that are strictly greater than this starting point (the extreme exceedances).
    exceedances = errors[errors > u] - u
    
    # If there are barely any extreme errors, fallback to a standard 95% guess to prevent mathematical failure.
    if len(exceedances) < 10:
        return np.quantile(errors, 0.95)
        
    # Step 3: Calculate the mean and variance of these extreme errors.
    mean_ex = np.mean(exceedances)
    var_ex = np.var(exceedances)
    
    # Use the Method of Moments to fit a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) curve to these extreme errors.
    c = 0.5 * (1.0 - (mean_ex**2 / var_ex))
    scale = 0.5 * mean_ex * ((mean_ex**2 / var_ex) + 1.0)
    
    # Set the 'shape' parameter (xi) which controls how "fat" the tail of the curve is.
    xi = -c
    
    # Calculate what fraction of the total data actually made it into this extreme tail.
    p_u = len(exceedances) / len(errors)
    
    # Step 4: Calculate the dynamic threshold (Value-at-Risk) targeting a specific low false-positive rate.
    if xi == 0:
        # If the shape is 0, use the logarithmic exponential formula.
        z_q = u - scale * np.log(target_fpr / p_u)
    else:
        # Otherwise, use the standard Generalized Pareto Distribution formula to dynamically set the absolute limit.
        # Any log whose error score exceeds this dynamic 'z_q' limit is flagged as a system anomaly.
        z_q = u + (scale / xi) * (((target_fpr / p_u) ** -xi) - 1)
        
    return z_q
```

## 5. The Infrastructure & Execution Loop (`run_improvements.py`)
While the above 4 files represent the mathematical "brains" of the project, this file represents the "infrastructure". It orchestrates loading the datasets, splitting the data securely to prevent data leakage, training the models, and strictly calculating the Precision, Recall, and F1 scores.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_fscore_support
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

def run_bgl_autoencoder():
    # Load our extracted Semantic Word2Vec vectors and their true labels.
    data = np.load("data/BGL/preprocessed/features_w2v.npz")
    X = data["X_l2"]
    y = data["y"]
    
    # Identify which sequences are normal (Label = 0).
    normal_idx = np.where(y == 0)[0]
    
    # Setup K-Fold Cross Validation. This splits the normal data into 5 chunks.
    # We will train on 4 chunks and test on the 1 remaining chunk + all the anomalies.
    # This proves our model isn't just memorizing the data, but actually generalizing.
    kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
    metrics = {"p": [], "r": [], "f1": []}
    
    # Initialize our Deep Learning Autoencoder.
    model = AutoencoderModel(hidden_layer_sizes=(16, 8, 16))
    
    for fit_idx, test_normal_idx in kf.split(normal_idx):
        # The Training Data (Xf) contains ONLY normal sequences. NO anomalies allowed here.
        Xf = X[normal_idx[fit_idx]]
        
        # The Testing Data (Xt) contains unseen normal sequences AND all the anomalies.
        test_idx = np.concatenate([normal_idx[test_normal_idx], np.where(y == 1)[0]])
        Xt, y_test = X[test_idx], y[test_idx]
        
        # Train the Autoencoder purely on the normal data.
        fold_model.fit(Xf)
            
        # Get the anomaly scores (reconstruction error) for the training data to learn the threshold.
        ef = fold_model.predict_errors(Xf)
        # Get the anomaly scores for the test data to actually make predictions.
        et = fold_model.predict_errors(Xt)
        
        # Calculate the dynamic cutoff limit using Extreme Value Theory (POT).
        theta = compute_threshold_pot(ef, q=0.90, target_fpr=1e-3)
        
        # If the test score is strictly greater than the threshold, flag it as an anomaly (1).
        y_pred = (et > theta).astype(int)
        
        # Calculate Precision (how many flagged were real?), Recall (how many real did we flag?), and F1 (balance).
        p, r, f1, _ = precision_recall_fscore_support(y_test, y_pred, average='binary', zero_division=0)
        
        metrics["p"].append(p); metrics["r"].append(r); metrics["f1"].append(f1)

    # Output the final average scores across all 5 folds.
    print(f"FINAL BGL AUTOENCODER RESULT:")
    print(f"Precision: {np.mean(metrics['p'])*100:.2f}%")
    print(f"Recall:    {np.mean(metrics['r'])*100:.2f}%")
    print(f"F1 Score:  {np.mean(metrics['f1'])*100:.2f}%")
```

## 6. The Complete Project Architecture (The 28 Files)
It is a common misconception that AI projects are just a few lines of code. The total size of this project in `src/` is **28 Python scripts** totaling nearly **4,500 lines of code**. The files we explained above are the mathematical innovations. The rest of the codebase is the massive infrastructure required to extract data, parse logs, benchmark algorithms, test 30 different random seeds, and prove the baseline paper flawed.

### Group A: Baseline Replication (HDFS focus)
*   **`src/baseline_replication/models/pca_rpca.py`**: The core PCA/RPCA math.
*   **`src/baseline_replication/run_baseline.py`**: The execution loop to prove the baseline paper on HDFS.

### Group B: Our Contributions & New Models (BGL focus)
*   **`src/our_contributions/features/bgl_pipeline.py`**: Downloads and parses raw BGL supercomputer text via Drain.
*   **`src/our_contributions/features/extract_sequences.py`**: Helper script for parsing.
*   **`src/our_contributions/features/extract_embeddings.py`**: The Node-Based grouping and Word2Vec semantic conversion.
*   **`src/our_contributions/models/deep_learning.py`**: The MLP Autoencoder and Isolation Forest architectures.
*   **`src/our_contributions/models/thresholding.py`**: The Extreme Value Theory (POT) dynamic thresholds.
*   **`src/our_contributions/run_improvements.py`**: Orchestrates testing our new pipeline.
*   **`src/our_contributions/run_improvements_leak_fixed.py`**: Prevents data-leakage during validation.
*   **`src/our_contributions/run_lstm_autoencoder.py`**: Experimental script for LSTM sequences.
*   **`src/our_contributions/benchmark.py`**: Final battle script pitting the linear models vs our deep learning models.

### Group C: The Archive (The Trial & Error Journey)
The remaining 17 scripts (e.g., `archive/attempt_1_rank_collapse/`, `archive/seed_search.py`, `archive/paper_exact.py`) represent hundreds of hours of failed hypotheses, testing, and debugging. They contain our attempts to fix rank collapse, our attempts to map arbitrary 5-minute time windows (the "semantic soup" failure), and our parameter sweeps proving the base paper's 90.55% claim was statistically unreachable. They are the proof of rigorous scientific process.
